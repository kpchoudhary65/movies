# DATABASE

I used Postgres database so you need to create the postgres database. You can use DATABASE_NAME, DATABASE_USER Or DATABASE_PASSWORD as you want if you do this then you will need to replace the DATABASE_NAME, DATABASE_PASSWORD Or DATABASE_USER in the <__init__.py file>.

Otherwise just use this commands and you have no need to change anything in the code

#commands for creating the postgres database.
```
1. CREATE DATABASE movies;

2. CREATE USER movieusers WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'movieworld';

3. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE movies TO movieusers;

```

# Create admin

```
flask fab create-admin

Add your credentials like <username> <password>
```

# Run the application

```
export FLASK_APP=app
flask run 

```
You will get the url like <http://127.0.0.1:5000> go to the url and login with the your admin cresentials
